# Scheduler
This is a persisten Java application that tackles the complicated task of scheduling classes. It will take in a list of courses, professor and their preffered day and time. Depending on the credit hours of the course, it will try to schedule the classa the preffered time, if this is unsuccesfull, it will look at a different day at that time. If this is also unsuccesfull, it will loop through all possible times on all days until it found an open slot. The output will be a schedule, and the user has the option to keep the schedule and insert more classes or delete it and start a new one.
